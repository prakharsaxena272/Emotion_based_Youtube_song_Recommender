There's a place, you gotta be
A thousand leagues beneath, the sea

Get ready for, the party's on tonight!

Leave your worries, all behind

Swats the bliakes that are on the way
When the big fish come the train
Guarantee you have best night of your life
Prive your socks and shine your shoes
Tell yourâ€¦
