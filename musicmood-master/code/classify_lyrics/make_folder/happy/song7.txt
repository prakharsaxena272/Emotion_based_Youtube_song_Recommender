Girl my body don't lie, I'm outta my mind
Let it rain over me, I'm rising so high
Out of my mind, so let it rain over me
Ay ay ay, ay ay ay let it rain over me
Ay ay ay, ay ay ay let it rain over me
A billion's the new million
Voli's the new vodka
Forty is the new thirty
And baby you're a rock star
Dale veterana, que tú sabes
Más de la cuenta, no te hagas
Teach me baby or better yet
Freak me baby, yes, yes
I'm freaky baby I'mma make sure that your peach feels peachy baby
No bullshit broads, I like my women sexy classy sassy
Powerful yes, they love to get the middle, nasty ow
This ain't a game you'll see, you can put the blame on me
Dale muñequita ahora ahi, and let it rain over me
Girl my body don't lie, I'm outta my mind
Let it…
