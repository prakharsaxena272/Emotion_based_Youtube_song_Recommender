Maine pehne party shoes gonna let my body loose
I have worn the party shoes and going to let my body loose


Karli hai thodi booze let's party on my mind
I have drink a little quantity of alcohol, let's party on my mind


Hai horsey horsey ride
Hai horsey horsey ride


Because Saturday hai night aur music bhi hai light
Because this is a Saturday night, and the music too is light


Let's party on my mind mind mind
Let's party on my mind mind mind


Yun karte party sharty aye aoa aye aye ao
Let's party-sharty this way


Jaise ho pehli bari aye aoa aye aye ao
Like it is for the first time


Saansen thak jayen jo kehte chal ghar latko
Let the breathe be tired if its says let's go home


Chila chila kehdo aye aoa aye aye ao
Shout at the top of your voice and say aa ae ai o


Masti ki kholo khidki aye aoa aye aye ao
Open the window of fun aa ae ai o


Jaise parwaah na kal ki
Like there is no worry for tomorrow


kadmo ko khidki do hathon ko upar lo
raise your hands and feet


aankhen do band kardo aye aoa aye aye ao
Close your eyes aa ae ai o


Maine pehne party shoes
I have worn the party shoes


gonna let my body loose
and going to let my body loose


Karli hai thodi booze
I have drink a little quantity of alcohol


let's party on my mind
let's party on my mind


Hai horsey horsey ride
Hey Horsey horsey ride
