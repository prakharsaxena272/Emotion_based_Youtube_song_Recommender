Guess it's true
I'm not good at a one night stand
But I still need love 'cause I'm just a man
These nights never seem to go to plan
I don't want you to leave
Will you hold my hand
Oh, won't you stay with me
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me
Why am I so emotional
No it's not a good look, gain some self control
Deep down I know this never works
But you could lay with me
So it doesn't hurt
Oh, won't you stay with me
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me
