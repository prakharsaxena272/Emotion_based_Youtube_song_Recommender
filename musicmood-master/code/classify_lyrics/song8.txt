Ladies up in here tonight
No fighting
We got the refugees up in here
No fightin', no fightin'
Shakira, Shakira
I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man wants to speak Spanish
Como se llama, bonita, mi casa, su casa (sí, sí)
Shakira, Shakira
Oh, baby, when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise and keep on
Reading the signs of my body
I'm on tonight
You know my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see, baby, this is perfection?
Hey, girl, I can see your body moving
And it's driving me crazy
And I didn't have the slightest idea
Until I saw you dancing
And when you walk up on the dance floor
Nobody cannot ignore the way you move your body, girl
And everything…
